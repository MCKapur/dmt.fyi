								<blockquote className="quote" cite="">Metaphorically, DMT is like an intellectual black hole in that once one knows about it, it is very hard for others to understand what one is talking about. One cannot be heard. The more one is able to articulate what it is, the less others are able to understand. This is why I think people who attain enlightenment, if we may for a moment comap these two, are silent. They are silent because we cannot understand them. Why the phenomenon of tryptamine ecstasy has not been looked at by scientists, thrill seekers, or anyone else, I am not sure, but I recommend it to your attention.

							      This time I was swept under a door crack and taken into a dark corridor. Everything around me was black, except for the beings, who appeared to be brightly glowing blue light beings. This time I was not greeted per se, but rather they were all doing yoga. There were several of them, poised in mannequin-like yoga positions, and sharing their wisdom through my attentiveness. I felt confused by their desire to teach me yoga, and questioned the message I was being sent. I was shown the door through which I had originally slipped under, but chose to stay and learn from them. However, after several minutes of watching them perform yoga I directed myself back towards the door. It seemed as if I was not quite prepared to hear the message, as was the case with my first trip.

							      All I saw with my eyes closed were these geometric shapes that were all interlocked and gracefully flowing. The color of these shapes was like clear crystal. Each had droplets of other colors within them: blue, pink, red, green. My vision was in 3-D. Some shapes were in the foreground, others in the background. Slowly they would switch from foreground to background. I was aware of nothing else but this vision. I had no memory of anything else. I had no point of reference anymore other than this vision. Nothing else existed. This was my entire universe at that moment.

	                  I had left my body & ego, my memories, morals and fears, and I had entered Nirvana. I was home. Flying through a multidimensional place of pure vision and thought, I saw endless arches of golden salamanders, flowing through the very fabric of space & time, their colors changing and rotating like countless kaleidoscopes, smiling and looking at me. My form and vision were shifting all the time, and I saw countless non-defined being, animals, flowers, trees, jewels and crystals, while the salamanders were telling and showing me the secret of life. Heavenly music, harp-strings and choirs ad infinitum were caressing my mental g-spot. There were no questions anymore, all was answered, and there was eternal unity. I was omnipotent. I was the universe. And the universe laughed and laughed, about itself and the joke of life it pulled on it! The most beautiful place in the universe, and I had found it! It's soooo sweet, soooo beautifull and loving, it's magic.

	                  I lost all my bearings; I knew I was once again in that familiar place known as hyperspace but I forgot who I was and how I got there. I was in absolutely awe as this 'web' morphed into what appeared as a plasma octopoid with flailing appendages similar to tentacles that were moving VERY fast and appeared to be tending to some task quite dilligently. In addition when these tentacles would move they would emit a reverberating set of tones each movement produced a unique set of harmonic audio expressions. Soon I became aware that this 'octopoid' was actually redirecting my awareness to these *incredible* structures that were made with his appendages/harmonic manipulations. Each time my attention would come to rest I would suddenly feel my awareness redirected to another structure being built that was more spectacular than the last. Before long I noticed a pressure in my center and I realized once again I was contained in a physical vehicle and that I was perceiving the weight of my hands interlaced on my solar plexus. My ego was reassembling itself and the web/octopoid simultaneously was losing its animate life-like qualities.

	                  As soon as felt the rush (for lack of a better term) I leaned back and closed my eyes. Within seconds it felt as though I was being pulled into myself and at the same time my entire being was expanding out through the universe. The visuals at this point seemed to match this feeling, as if traveling through space at warp speed with far off galaxies rushing by. The expanding feeling stopped rather sharply and was replaced with a sense of ease that I can't even begin to describe. As this new feeling settled in I began to see myself among the swirling images racing by. As the feeling of peace got deeper and deeper my form sitting across from me began telling me that everything was OK, life is life, it was nothing to fear. It's crazy but this was exactly what I needed to hear, and, as soon as the words where spoken a rush of happiness/love overwhelmed me. It felt as though my body was going to explode into millions of pieces from the emotions building inside.

							<p className="faq-title" id="faq-title-10">Are these experiences... real?</p>
							<p className="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-10" onClick={(e) => { e.stopPropagation(); }}>Nobody knows. Some ‚Äî especially psychonauts like Rick Strassman ‚Äî believe that the DMT hyperspace and the entities in it are real. It is said that a DMT experience can feel so profound, meaningful, and truthful that it wins over those who never believed in spirituality. The unmistakable connections between DMT experiences seems even more unexplainable.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Yet, others theorize that DMT simply produces remarkably strong effects on human brain chemistry, drawing comparisons to dream states. The <i>feeling</i> of meaningfulness in these intense visual stimuli might not correlate to real meaning; this is known as "apophenia". Entities might appear due to the brains' cognitive tendency to look for anthropomorphic patterns in things, our imaginative power, and data from our unconscious mind. <sup className="source"><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201408/dmt-gateway-reality-fantasy-or-what" target="_blank">10</a></sup></p>

							<p className="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-11" onClick={(e) => { e.stopPropagation(); }}>This is a more interesting question. Both on DMT, and off DMT, we are perceiving reality through our sensory perception tools. A drug like DMT alters these tools; but we still don't know if these tools give us a true window to reality, and in which state these tools give the truer window.

							<br/>
							<br/>

							Perhaps DMT lets us observe reality in a less filtered, more chaotic, and all-encompassing form. Perhaps it doesn't! If DMT doesn't project us into a new dimension, perhaps it feeds into our unconscious mind and lets us unlock things about ourselves represented and manifested in the mystical hyperspace; this is why many report that DMT trips have helped them make important changes in their lives.

							<br/>
							<br/>

							By reading DMT reports, we can surely start to formulate questions about the power of the human mind and our interaction with reality.</p>

								Absolutely. DMT is the main ingredient used in a drink called Ayahuasca. Ayahuasca is widely used by the Amazon basin indigenous tribes. It is specifically used during Shamanic rituals, where "shamans" conduct a ceremony centered around consumption of the drink and the spiritual journey following it. Ayahuasca extends the DMT trip to hours, and is extremely phyiscally tolling on the body. <sup className="source"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca" target="_blank">12</a></sup>

								Good question! There are actually <i>two</i> types of DMT: our good ol' DMT ‚Äî <i>N,N-Dimethyltryptamine</i> ‚Äî and <i>5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine</i>, or 5-MeO-DMT for short. 5-MeO-DMT is commonly known as "The God Molecule"; it's more potent than regular DMT but produces less intense visuals. It's also considered more dangerous than regular DMT. <sup className="source"><a href="http://www.psychedelicheaven.com/2018/06/13/dmt-vs-5-meo-dmt/" target="_blank">13</a></sup> <sup className="source"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/5-MeO-DMT.svg" target="_blank">14</a></sup>

								5-MeO-DMT is known less for projecting users into an eventful entity-inhabited hyperspace, and more for completely destroying the user's sense of self and merging the user with the entirety of the universe and the universe's energy ‚Äî somewhat like becoming God. A lot of users report feeling an overwhelming sense of void while peaking on 5-MeO-DMT. <sup className="source"><a href="https://psychedelictimes.com/psychedelics/what-is-the-difference-between-5-meo-dmt-and-dmt-choosing-a-dmt-therapy/" target="_blank">15</a></sup>

								Yes. DMT is produced in the brain. Some speculate that during, or near, death, DMT is released in the brain.

								<strong>Why not?</strong> Because it is <strong>ILLEGAL</strong>; because you might not be ready for it; you could experience something wildly terrifying, unsettling, upsetting; you could emotionally scar yourself, short-term and long-term; you could become belligerent during your trip (it has happened); you could come back a different person you entered, and you might not be prepared for that; just like it could make things better, it could make things worse. These are all <i>very</i> real things.

								You can smoke, snort, ingest, or inject DMT. The YouTube channel PsychedSubstance has an excellent crash course on how to smoke DMT safely. It is not worth attempting to duplicate the information over here. The delivery would not be as convincing, or effective. Watching this video before taking DMT is absolutely paramount. Please test your DMT (to make sure it really is DMT), using a <a href="https://testkitplus.com/?ap_id=psychedsubstance" className="link">DMT Test Kit</a>, before taking it.

								Psychonauts are nice people. This <a className="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/304dgp/please_post_your_advice_for_first_timers_here/">Reddit thread</a> has a ton of great advice. The five best tips are compiled below.
								<div class="notepaper">
		            		The first thing to know, and probably the most important, everything will be okay! No matter what happens, so long as you dose correctly (and even if you don't, to a degree), you will be totally fine. The medicine will take care of you, the universe will keep you safe. While the experience is indescribable and wild, your body will be perfectly fine. Wherever you go during the experience, you will come back in about 5 minutes.
									</div>
									<div class="notepaper">
		            		Do this on a good day, when your headspace is relatively clear, no responsibilities, not much to worry about. Do it in a good place where you feel comfortable, either alone or with people you trust. I recommend doing this with no music, as I feel like it forces you into reality for the beginning part of the trip. Though what really matters is what makes you comfortable!
									</div>
									<div class="notepaper">
		            		Assuming you took "the third hit", are you willing to surrender yourself? Letting go is the most important step in the process. It can mean the difference between being ripped apart (metaphorically of course) or being pulled out of yourself and into a beautiful experience. I prefer the latter, and it's easier to achieve than you might think! Just don't worry, remember the medicine wants to take you somewhere beautiful. I've struggled with this at times, relinquishing control is scary, and might require some practice.
									</div>
									<div class="notepaper">
		            		One thing I did when I really started to freak out during the trip was focus on my breathing - much in the same way you're instructed to breath during meditation or yoga. No matter how scared you are, no matter how sure you are that you are dying, the sensation of breathing will remind you everything is okay and it'll all be over soon. This is a good way to snap yourself out of being fearful, as fear will cloud your ability to interpret and enjoy the experience.

		            		Let go.
